1-Measure of central tendency

mean = sum/n

ex: 1,2,4,8  their mean is   (1+2+4+8)/4

median : the number in the middle

mode : the most repeated number


2-measures of dispersion

range = biggest value - the smallest value
ex: 5,7,9,2 their range =  7
standard deviation = (the sum of( Xi-X)*2/(n-1))*.5


3-quarties: it is the process of dividing the data into four equal parts after arranging them

ex: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7
Q2 = 4
Q1 = 2
Q3 = 6
